PREFLOP STRATEGY 
    - Practice exploit with good hands : 
        1) (1v1 situation from SB)
        flat call on a small raise and 20/30xMORE raise
        on a re-raise to make the guy fold

        2) jam 14/20xMORE with big hands (top pairs or aks, aqs)
        and small prize. Micro-stakes players love to gamble

    - Don't call from SB/BB if not in top15%

    - if IP against OOP opening, fold and 3-raise only
    if the guy is betting on everything

    - if OOP and under 20BBprize against an IP opening
    go ALL IN // if IP against nothing with good hand, go
    go BIGRAISE, the SB or BB could be us, we want to scare them

FLOP STRATEGY 
    - Check raise if flush draw (1v1 situation)
    - limpers dont bluff : we OOP with bad FLOP,
    we get IP raised by a limper, we FOLD
    - when people flop pairs, they can't fold. so BET BIG
    if better 
    - What should i ask my self before a big CALL : 
        How likely is raising with the best value hand ?
    - When the passive players start bombing the pot, FOLD

TURN STRATEGY 
    - Micro stake player do not fold ! Don't bluff late.
        They want to close the loop.
